 Treehouse Unit 7 Project


<h1>Web application project for Treehouse. </h1>

<p>
This project showcases HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It resembles a fake web application social networking website. 
There are sections with user information, traffic charts, user updates, and some interactive 
elements. </p>
<p>
The project is structured using CSS Grid for the overall layout and Flexbox for each individual widget. 
JavaScript is used to display the charts and add interactivity for the first chart with the data being changed depending on what mode the user selects. A message section will result with an alert box for the user to confirm if the message contained the required fields (select user, write a message). If the conditions are met, a successful alert box will appear - otherwise an error will appear in the alert box with the appropriate instructions. The settings section uses localStorage to save the settings even after the page is refreshed. The cancel button negates any changes and resets to base values. The settings that are able to be saved include two toggle switches (on/off) and a drop down menu to select a timezone. 
At the top of the page there is a bell icon to represent notifications. When there are notifications, a green dot will appear on the bell icon. After clicked, the green dot goes away and a drop down menu of notification items appears. Clicking outside the notification drop down menu will close the menu.
